    <h1>Introducing Cats</h1>

    <h2>I Have Other Pets In My Home</h2>

    <p>
      How do you successfully introduce a new cat into your household if you
      already have other pets? As cats can be territorial creatures, bringing a
      new kitty home to meet Fido or Fluffy can be a hair-raising experience for
      not only the owner but also the resident pets—if not handled correctly. A
      peaceful relationship between new and existing feline or canine housemates
      requires time, patience and work. The introduction process generally takes
      a few weeks before the pets are all cohabitating peacefully. At times,
      though, it can take several weeks. The trick is to do it slowly and
      cautiously…and follow the guidelines below.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Isolate the new cat in a separate “Safe Room”.</b> That is closed off
        from the other pets (make sure the door is securely shut and doesn’t
        open easily). This smaller, confined area will help the new cat to feel
        safe and adjust more quickly to his new home. Provide a litter box,
        scratching post, toys, food, and water in the new cat’s room. This
        separation will also give your current pets time to get used to the new
        cat’s smell and the idea of having a new occupant in the house. During
        the first week, the only interaction that your new cat and resident cats
        should have is playing paws under the door.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Remember. cats like routine, not change.</b> Your resident cats’
        behavior may initially change when you first bring the new cat home.
        Most common is hissing, growling, hiding or fighting among resident
        pets. Your current cats may even act differently toward you by
        displaying aggression or ignoring you all together. With your new cat in
        his “safe room,” the new and resident cats will all have the opportunity
        to become familiar with each others’ scents while safely separated by a
        door. As they begin to acclimate to each other, the cats will feel less
        threatened and, with time, the negative behavior should dissipate.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Always introduce a new cat to the resident cats</b> before
        introducing him to the resident dog(s). In most cases, the cat to cat
        introductions will be more harried, with the cat to dog introductions
        being somewhat easier.{' '}
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Introducing Cats to Each Other</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The new cat and resident cats should have{' '}
        <b>no face-to-face interaction for the first week.</b> This will allow
        the new cat time to get comfortable with his new environment and family.
        The stress of a new environment can cause a cat to show signs of an
        upper respiratory infection (watch for sneezing, eye or nose discharge)
        or diarrhea. Watch to make sure that the new cat is eating well,
        drinking and using the litter box. In almost every case, a cat that does
        not use his litter box is suffering from a medical condition. Any
        instance of inappropriate elimination (outside of the litter box) should
        be followed up with a visit to the vet.
      </li>
      <li>
        After keeping the new cat in a room of his own for the first week,{' '}
        <b>start introducing the smells of each cat to the other.</b> You can do
        this by brushing all of the cats with the same brush to get their scents
        on each other. Also, try feeding them each a special treat on either
        side of the door. Doing so will help each cat to associate the smell of
        the other cat with the positive experience of eating the treat (usually
        wet food works best). You may want to have your resident cats go into
        the new cat’s room (and visa versa) when he is not there to help them
        get acclimated to his scent.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>After introducing smells for a few days,</b> when you are ready for
        the first face-to-face introduction, put the new cat in his carrier and
        let the resident cats come into the “safe room.” This will give you an
        opportunity to observe the interaction among the cats while the new cat
        is protected in his carrier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Usually with this initial meeting there will be some hissing</b>{' '}
        and/or posturing. If the interaction seems as though it could lead to
        aggression, you will need to do this controlled introduction using the
        carrier a few more times before removing the barriers and allowing the
        cats to meet face-to-face. If the cats all appear to be curious or
        simply wary with no outward signs of aggression, then you can open the
        carrier door and let the new cat walk out into the territory of the
        resident cats. <b>Do not rush this process.</b> It is very important to
        the long term harmony of their relationship that the introduction
        process proceed at a pace comfortable for each of the cats.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Monitor all interactions closely during the first weeks.</b> Do not
        leave the cats alone unsupervised until you are comfortable that there
        will not be aggressive behavior displayed by any of the cats. During the
        first few weeks, the new cat should stay in his “safe room” when no one
        is home to supervise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>If interaction among the cats deteriorates instead of improving,</b>{' '}
        return the new cat to his “safe room.” At this point you will need to
        start the introduction process again, this time, taking more time at
        each stage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Introducing a Cat and a Dog</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        When you bring a new cat into your house, you need to{' '}
        <b>set up a “safe room”</b> where the cat can stay for at least the
        first week. The room chosen must have a door and should be in a quiet
        part of the house. You will need to provide access to food, water,
        litter box, and scratching post at all times (see first bullet point
        above for more details). If you have cats as well as dogs in your home,
        the cats should have already been successfully introduced to the
        newcomer before initiating introduction of the new cat to your dogs.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        There should be <b>no face-to-face interactions</b> between the new cat
        and resident dog for the first week. Bring the cat into the house in his
        carrier and take him directly to his “safe room.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Don’t introduce the cat to any other pets until he has settled in</b>{' '}
        and seems to be comfortable with the human members of the household.
        This comfort will be evidenced by the cat becoming interactive with you
        when you enter his “safe room.” Many cats will initially hide for a
        couple of days when brought to a new home, but will soon become
        comfortable if given time and space.{' '}
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>When your new cat seems to be comfortable with you,</b> it is time to
        start the introductions with your dog. During these introductions, the
        dog should always be crated or on leash, allowing the cat to approach
        the dog on his own terms. This may well be the first time that the cat
        is outside of his “safe room.” Allow him to explore at his own pace and
        approach the dog if he is comfortable doing so. All introductions should
        be supervised and conducted during quiet times of the day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Carefully watch the first contact between cat and dog.</b> Let them
        sniff each other. Be ready with a towel or squirt gun in case of any
        aggressive behavior. The situation should be fairly well controlled,
        though, because the dog will be confined in his crate or on a leash. If
        either animal displays aggressive or fearful behavior, separate them
        immediately. Try again later (possibly the next day) after things have
        calmed down.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the initial meeting goes well, you will still want to{' '}
        <b>repeat the encounter several times</b> under controlled circumstances
        before letting the animals roam freely in the house or leaving them
        together unsupervised.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your new cat is a small kitten,{' '}
        <b>take special precautions whenever the cat and dog are together.</b> A
        large dog may not intend to harm a kitten, he simply may not know his
        own strength or understand the fragility of a young kitten.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be sensitive to the fact that{' '}
        <b>some dog breeds are naturally not good at cohabitating with cats</b>
        —certain breeds may instinctually be driven to chase or act aggressively
        toward a cat. You will need to evaluate your pet’s personality and
        determine if he is an exception to the general rule for his breed. Take
        extra time and care when introducing the two animals—always under close
        supervision. Be aware that your dog may behave better when you are
        present, so allow ample time for supervised interactions before letting
        them to be alone together.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tips To Encourage Harmony</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        To speed acceptance of a new cat, after following the above introduction
        processes, try feeding the cats at opposite ends of room. Gradually,
        over time, move the food bowls closer together. After feeding them
        side-by-side for a week, the cats should be ready to roam through out
        the house freely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide plenty of safe, comfortable sleeping/nesting places if you have
        several pets. Cats especially need their space. They are not as social
        as dogs and often prefer isolation at times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the cat’s food in a location out of the dog’s reach—either up on a
        counter or ledge or in an area that is barricaded so that the dog cannot
        enter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Maintain separate litter boxes (they eventually may share). The general
        rule is one litter box for each cat plus one.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure litter boxes are placed in quiet, easily accessible locations
        that do not present opportunities for a cat to be cornered by other
        pets. While litter boxes should be accessible to the cats, they should
        be out of reach of any resident dogs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, in spite of your best efforts, sometimes the resident pets
      will not accept the new cat into their home. After a month of working
      through the techniques listed above, if your pets have not progressed past
      outward displays of aggression, it is time to consider the possibility
      that the new cat may not be able to integrate into your family. If this
      turns out to be the case, unless you are willing to maintain separate
      living quarters for warring pets, you may need to find the newcomer a new
      home. If you originally adopted the cat from 4Paws, pursuant to the
      Adoption Contract, you are required to return the cat to the organization.
    </p>

    <h2>I Don't Have Any Other Pets In My Home</h2>

    <p>If you don’t have any other pets in the house, you should still start your new cat in a “safe room.” Cats like smaller, more confined spaces. Your new pet will acclimate better if started in a single room instead of being given access to the whole house right away.
    </p>

    <p>The “safe room” should have a secure door and be away from the noise and activity of the rest of the house. Generally you want to choose a room that does not offer a lot of hiding places (like under a bed). The room that you choose should be a place where family members can easily interact with the cat-- usually a den works best.</p>

    <p>Set up the “safe room” before bringing your new cat home. The room should have food, water, litter box, scratching post and toys. When you bring your new pet home, leave him in the carrier until you get to the room where he will be staying. Once in the room, open the carrier door and let him come out at his own pace.</p>

    <p>Remember, everything is very new and could be scary for your cat—new sounds and smells, separation from the familiar, etc. Give your cat time to settle into his new surrounds before lavishing him with attention. It may take a few or several days before he becomes comfortable with you… be patient and compassionate. It may help for you or other members of the family to just sit in the room with him and talk to him. After a couple of days, try playing with an interactive toy, such as a laser light or feather toy. Also, offering smelly fishy food is always a good way to go. To paraphrase-- the quickest way to a kitty’s heart is through his stomach.
    </p>

    <p>Once your new furry friend seems comfortable with family members, you can start introducing him to the rest of the house or apartment. In general, your cat should stay in his “safe room” for at least the first week. When the cat seems ready to venture out of his room, let him explore at his own pace. He will probably walk around carefully smelling every nook and cranny. Kitty should continue to stay in his room when you are not home until you are comfortable that he feels at home outside of his “safe room”—usually a second week will suffice for an adult cat, but longer for kittens.</p>

    <p>Once your new pet gets free roam of the house, you will most likely want to move the litter box to its permanent location. Any time you move the litter box, you should put the cat in the box (at the new location) and let him explore from that reference.</p>

    <p>Some cats will acclimate to a new home faster than others. Following the steps listed above, will ensure a smoother transition for any cat. Best to be safe and go slow than to rush things and have a “scaredy” cat on your hands (or under the sofa).</p>
