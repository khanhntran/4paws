Imagine a very young and pregnant kitty being dumped in a warehouse area frightened and alone where there are lots of trucks and vans coming and going. She sees a hole in one of the warehouse doors and climbs in a huge mostly empty place and seeks somewhere to have her kittens. She ends up in a ceiling with wires and pipes, but at least it is quiet as there is no current tenant. She is so young that she only has two kittens.

To cut a long story short, a local cat lover heard about the young mother’s predicament and arranged for the family to be trapped and brought into the 4Paws program. Only one of the kittens could be captured, and rescuers are still looking for the other. Mother Portia and kitten Skye have received necessary vet care and are being cared for in a 4Paws foster home until the two find a home together. They are eating up a storm and gaining weight.

Portia and her son Skye are simply adorable. They clearly love each other very much and play constantly together and with many toys. Skye loves to play with Portia’s tail and sometimes they play-wrestle together. Portia is so young, she is like another kitten when it comes to play. After playing, they take a nap together and both use their scratching posts. They are lovely shades of white and gray and look very much alike. Sweet is the best word to describe both kitties.

It would just be wonderful if someone gave these two charming kitties a new life together to grow up in a forever home where they will bring new parents much joy for many years.

The vet estimates that Portia was born in 2017 and Skye was born in early spring 2018. Portia has been spayed, and Skye has been neutered. Both have had vaccinations appropriate for their age and have been micro chipped. They have tested negative for FIV and FeLV.
