Ice comes to 4Paws from a shelter in central Virginia.

He is an affectionate, friendly, outgoing boy who just wants to be loved. He hasn't been in a 4Paws foster home yet and we don't know his background with other cats, so if he is adopted into a home with another feline, proper introductions need to be followed.

His estimated birthdate is August 2017. He is neutered, tested negative for FIV and feline leukemia, is current on vaccinations, and has been micro chipped.
