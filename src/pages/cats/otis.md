Otis is an outgoing & friendly young cat who would do best on a household with another active cat to play with. He enjoys being held like a baby and is cuddly, so he could also be a great fit for a family with children. He is very adaptable to change and not afraid of strangers. He will greet your guests upon arrival! He is food motivated, so you can earn his love quickly thru his tummy! He enjoys playing with toy mice, feather or string wands, chasing balls, red dot off of a laser pointer, or just climbing a cat tree. When he is not engaged in play, he in an avid window watcher.



Otis prefers horizontal scratchers and would love to have a water fountain in his adoptive home. He loves to play with running water!



Otis is is estimated to be born around April 2016. He is neutered, current on rabies & distemper vaccinations, tested negative for FIV & feline leukemia and is microchipped.
