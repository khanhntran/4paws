Lucy is a young long-haired Calico mother who was abandoned while pregnant and rescued just days before she had her kittens.

She is a very special kitty who loves people and always wants to be included (even for household chores!). She runs to greet visitors, tail up and purring! Her foster mom has been rescuing cats for over 25 years and has only met one or two others with such an endearing personality. She is an amazing cat--very lady-like and well behaved and always friendly, sweet and unafraid, even at the vet’s. Lucy is clever and playful and regal. She’s quiet and gentle, yet very interested and inquisitive. Lucy is wonderful with children and travels well. She is THE Perfect Cat and absolutely gorgeous too.

The vet estimates Lucy is about 1 year old. She has been spayed and micro chipped, and she is current on her vaccinations. She has tested negative for FIV/FeLV.
