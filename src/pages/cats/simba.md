Simba is an absolute gentleman who will quickly capture your heart. He is a purring machine and is the sweetest kitty. He just needs a quiet and stable household with no other pets in order to be at his best.



Simba enjoys outside time and loves to walk in his backyard on a harness/leash. He startles easily from loud noises, so the backyard is his favorite place to be. He loves to listen to the birds, watch the leaves fall, and maybe sneak in some pieces of grass (when his owner isn't watching him).



Simba is an absolute delight and will warm up to you quickly. He is currently taking an anti-anxiety pill in the morning (because he is living with 3 other female cats) and takes a prednisone pill in the evening for stomach issues. His vet said that Simba's new owners can reexamine his pill regimen after he moves to a less stressful environment. He is an incredibly easy-to-pill kitty and can even be pilled when he is lying down. Simba will only eat dry food, and it is best to keep him on Blue Wilderness Indoor cat food because he is used to it for now.



Simba is estimated to have been born in 2007. He is neutered, micro-chipped, and up to date on his vaccinations. He has tested negative for FIV/FeLV.
