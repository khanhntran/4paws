      The 4Paws Rescue Team is a nonprofit community-based all volunteer
      organization that takes in neglected, abandoned, abused and unwanted cats
      and kittens. Cats rescued by 4Paws receive vaccines and appropriate
      veterinary care before being adopted into permanent, loving homes. An
      animal rescued by 4Paws will never be euthanized except out of medical
      necessity.
